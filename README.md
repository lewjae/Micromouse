### Micromouse Robot

#### Description

Navigating in unknown real world is a key challenge in autonomous vehicle or mobile robot application.  In this project, the problem is simplified as a robot navigating in an unknown maze and finding its optimal path.

The scope of the project is to develop a motion planning algorithm that enables a robot to explore an unknown maze (environment), to learn the maze layout, and then to find its fastest path from a corner of the maze to its center.  

#### Method

Used A* like approach for exploring and learning unknown mazes and Dynamic Programming for finding its fastest path. 

#### Usage

To run the program:
`python tester.py  test_maze_01.txt`

To display the maze:
`python showmaze.py test_maze_01.txt`
